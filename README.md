# CastGd_V1
A "Retro" RayCaster Demo

## Description
This is a simple ray caster example and is equivalent and based upon the example in the tutorial by @3DSage here: https://github.com/3DSage/OpenGL-Raycaster_v1

The original was written in C. I have tried to stick to Godot principles and naming and split out the functionality into different scenes and functions.
This was intended as a learning excercise but I quite like how it translates into Godot.
